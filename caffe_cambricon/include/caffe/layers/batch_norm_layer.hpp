/**
 * @brief Normalizes the input to have 0-mean and/or unit (1) variance across
 *        the batch.
 *
 * This layer computes Batch Normalization as described in [1]. For each channel
 * in the data (i.e. axis 1), it subtracts the mean and divides by the variance,
 * where both statistics are computed across both spatial dimensions and across
 * the different examples in the batch.
 *
 * By default, during training time, the network is computing global
 * mean/variance statistics via a running average, which is then used at test
 * time to allow deterministic outputs for each input. You can manually toggle
 * whether the network is accumulating or using the statistics via the
 * use_global_stats option. For reference, these statistics are kept in the
 * layer's three blobs: (0) mean, (1) variance, and (2) moving average factor.
 *
 * Note that the original paper also included a per-channel learned bias and
 * scaling factor. To implement this in Caffe, define a `ScaleLayer` configured
 * with `bias_term: true` after each `BatchNormLayer` to handle both the bias
 * and scaling factor.

 *     Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift." arXiv preprint
 *     arXiv:1502.03167 (2015).

 * TODO(dox): thorough documentation for Forward, Backward, and proto params.
