 * @brief MLU acceleration of BatchNormLayer
 *        Normalizes the input to have 0-mean and/or unit (1) variance across
 *        the batch.
 *
 * This layer computes Batch Normalization as described in [1]. For each channel
 * in the data (i.e. axis 1), it subtracts the mean and divides by the variance,
 * where both statistics are computed across both spatial dimensions and across
 * the different examples in the batch.
