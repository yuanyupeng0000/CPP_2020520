/**
 * @brief Ignores bottom blobs while producing no top blobs. (This is useful
 *        to suppress outputs during testing.)
 *        For example, if you want to make the input of relu layer (6th layer)
 *        be the top blob of conv layer (5th layer) instead of previous pooling
 *        layer (6th layer) but you don't want to remove the pooling layer for
 *        some reason, then it's where silence layer can be very useful.
