/**
 * @brief Shuffle channel layer was introduced by ShuffleNet which is a
 *        light weight network aims at applying to mobile devices.
 *        Shuffle different channels from the output of group convolution.
 *        Shuffle channel layer can be considered as a correction method
 *        to the production of group convolution.
 *        As features produced by group convolution are independent from
 *        each other in group wise, by shuffling different channels between
 *        groups, following layers can obtain features that produced in
 *        different groups.
