 * @brief Also known as a "fully-connected" layer, computes an inner product
 *        with a set of learned weights, and (optionally) adds biases.
 *
 * @param
 * num_output:
 * The number of outputs of the layer
 *
 * axis:
 * The first axis to be lumped into a single inner product computation;
 * all preceding axes are retained in the output.
 * May be negative to index from the end (e.g., -1 for the last axis).
 *
 * transpose:
 * Specify whether to transpose the weight matrix or not.
 * If transpose == true, any operations will be performed on the transpose
 * of the weight matrix. The weight matrix itself is not going to be transposed
 * but rather the transfer flag of operations will be toggled accordingly.
